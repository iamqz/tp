# QuickLookup User Guide

**QuickLookup** is a desktop application for managing a list of residents, optimized for users who prefer fast keyboard input via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still providing a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for visual feedback.

It allows users to quickly **add, remove, and view residents** in a locally stored list.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your QuickLookup.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar quicklookup.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.
   * `sort name` : Sorts the displayed list of residents by name.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the resident will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st resident to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* `n/` matches resident names as case-insensitive full words.
* `p/` matches phone numbers by substring.
* `u/` matches unit numbers by case-insensitive substring.
* `r/` matches resident roles exactly.
* Use `r/unassigned` to match residents with no role.
* Multiple search terms within the same field are combined using `OR`.
* Different fields are combined using `AND`.
* Unprefixed text is invalid.
  e.g. `find 9876 n/Bob` and `find n/Alex Bob` are not allowed

Examples:
* `find n/John` returns residents whose names contain the full word `John`
* `find p/9876` returns residents whose phone numbers contain `9876`
* `find u/02-25` returns residents whose unit numbers contain `02-25`
* `find r/HA` returns residents whose role is `HA`

### Saving the data

QuickLookup data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

QuickLookup data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, QuickLookup will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the QuickLookup to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Navigating command history using arrow keys

QuickLookup tracks your current session's command history for quick retrieval using the arrow keys. After navigating to a past command, you may execute it again by pressing Enter, or edit it before executing.

While the command box is focused, press:
- Up Arrow Key (`↑`) to display earlier commands.
- Down Arrow Key (`↓`) to display more recent commands.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous QuickLookup home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
